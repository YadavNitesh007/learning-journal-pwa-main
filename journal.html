        <h2>Week 2 – Fundamentals of Responsive Web Design</h2>

        <p><strong>1. How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
          <p>I began my design process with a mobile-first approach, utilizing a single-column layout, intuitive navigation, and responsive text sizes.
            I then implemented media queries to optimize the layout for tablets and desktop screens, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.</p>
      

        <p><strong>2. What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong><br>
          The most valuable concept I applied this week was using Flexbox and Grid to create flexible, well-structured layouts.
         Additionally, implementing responsive CSS and effective navigation between pages helped me better understand overall page structure and user experience.</p>

        <p><strong>3. What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
          The most challenging aspect was mastering responsive design with media queries and organizing project files in a clean, maintainable structure.
          Learning to integrate version control through GitHub was also new, but I was able to grasp it gradually through practice.</p>
